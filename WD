CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
- Total Contextual Elements Identified: 47
- Primary Context Focus: Firebase Android integration setup documentation and requirements
- Implied Context Addressed:
  • Technical audience (Android developers)
  • Multiple implementation paths available
  • Progressive complexity levels
  • Dependencies and prerequisites
- Context Gaps Filled:
  • [Assumption 1] User has basic Android development knowledge
  • [Assumption 2] User has access to Android Studio
  • [Assumption 3] User needs official Firebase integration guidance

OPTIMIZED CONTEXTUAL PROMPT:
[CONTEXT ANCHOR]
Create comprehensive Firebase Android integration instructions focusing on:
1. Prerequisites and system requirements
2. Two implementation paths:
   - Firebase Console method (recommended)
   - Firebase Assistant method
3. SDK implementation and dependency management

[CONTEXT SUPPORT]
Technical Requirements:
- Android Studio (latest version)
- API level 21+ (Android 5.0+)
- AndroidX compatibility
- Google Play services
- Firebase account

Implementation Steps Structure:
1. Project setup
2. App registration
3. Configuration file integration
4. SDK implementation
5. Gradle configuration

[CONTEXT REFINEMENT]
- Technical documentation style
- Step-by-step format
- Code examples in both Kotlin and Groovy
- Clear distinction between required and optional steps

[CONTEXT GUARDRAILS]
- Maintain version accuracy (BoM 34.2.0)
- Include all security considerations
- Preserve exact dependency syntax
- Note deprecated features

[CORE REQUEST]
Create a clear, structured guide for integrating Firebase into Android projects, with emphasis on best practices and common pitfalls.

CONTEXT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- How Context Drives This Prompt:
